## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16+)
- Python 3.8+
- pip (Python package manager)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone [(https://github.com/Ashifo7/Phone_Genie)](https://github.com/Ashifo7/Phone_Genie)
   cd PhoneGenie
   ```

2. **Set up the backend**
   ```bash
   # Create and activate virtual environment
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate

   # Install Python dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up the frontend**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

## üö¶ Running the Application

### Development Mode

1. **Start the backend server**
   ```bash
   # From project root
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Start the frontend development server**
   ```bash
   # From frontend directory
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

### Production Build

1. Build the frontend:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run build
   ```

2. The production build will be in the `dist` directory

## ü§ñ Machine Learning Models

### Training the Models

1. **Recommendation Model**
   - Trains on user preferences and phone specifications
   - Updates with user feedback for continuous improvement

2. **Viability Model**
   - Predicts phone longevity based on specifications and historical data
   - Continuously improves with new data

### Model Persistence
- Models are automatically saved in `ml/models/saved/`
- Includes both the model and its feature scaler

## üåê API Endpoints

- `GET /api/recommendations` - Get phone recommendations
- `POST /api/feedback` - Submit feedback on recommendations
- `GET /api/viability` - Get phone viability prediction

## üìä Data

Phone specifications and user preferences are stored in:
- `src/data/phones.ts` - Phone specifications database
- `src/types/phone.ts` - TypeScript interfaces for phone data

## ü§ù Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
5. Open a Pull Request
